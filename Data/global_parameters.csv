Simulation_parameters,Value,Description
Session,Basic,"Session: 'Basic','Uncertainty','Storage','Grid' "
Day,1,Select the day you want to study. The previous day will be used as a starting solution. Day 1 will be solved with cyclic boundary conditions.
UCM,Deterministic,"Unit commitment model: 'deterministic' or 'stochastic' or 'dispatch'. All results will be displayed for the selected day, under the forecast scenario for the SUCM."
Reserves rule,,Select the reserve rule you want to study: Flat or Probabilistic
Reserve level,0,"Select the amount of reserves you want to study. For flat: MW, for probabilistic: fraction of errors that you want to cover"
Share Wind,0.15,"Share of wind power in the electricity generation mix (energy basis, week)"
Share Solar,0.15,"Share of solar power in the electricity generation mix (energy basis, week)"
Time step,1,Time step of the simulation - do not change.
